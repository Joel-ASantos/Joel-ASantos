# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Joel Alves
## About me:
### I'm Joel , and i have 20 years old and i living in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
### I'm curious guy who likes to read strange books, and learn. When i was a kid, i always liked my computer, in those days i thought they're magic or something else, because in my mind they could do a everything. Well, i can presume that thought brought  me to study computers. I'm self-learner, in this moment i study data structures in C and Java to construct one future project.
